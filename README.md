This is the current production environment for the GEOMETOR project.

We are taking geometric models constructed in Geogrbra and exporting them into a custom SVG format so we can control the style and sequencing for print, web and animation.

This is primarily to document to the current research and to prepare for the continued development of GEOMETOR Explorer.

Various aspects of styling and animation control will be largely portable to the new platform.

There are a number of constructions evolving from our quest to seek the patterns of golden sections within certain proportional systems.

here are the current projects:

## Base
Base Template for Geogebra Constructions. Initial elements and custom tools read for a new construction.


## Unique External Golden Sections

This is a series seeking to find the unique constructions that lead to the baseline passiong thru the starting point being sectioned on either side of the unit in a Golden Section

## Unique Internal Golden Sections

these are constructions that lead to a Golden Section within the unit

## Systems

each of the unique studies above outlines a proportional system. Here we take each of these systems for a deeper look.
